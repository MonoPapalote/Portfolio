                    of programs that make life easier for other people. My technical experience and qualities obtained during my study journey are 
                    based on all the knowledge obtained in different areas (Programming, Database Administration, Networks), which were developed 
                    more and more as progress was made in the different courses, without However, it is impossible to cover all the different 
                    programming languages and areas on a large scale so that each learning and teaching obtained forms the basis for the beginning 
                    of my life as a professional to this day. I consider myself a person who works in a team, is creative and
                    organized, so that each of these qualities allow me to do a job of excellence and put my best effort into it. </p>
